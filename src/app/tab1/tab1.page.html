        <div>Music has the power to deeply move our souls.  It connects us with heaven revealing our God-given strength and potential.  It lifts us to higher purposes and inspires us to greater climbs.  Music can speak for us and to us.  It can express what our lips cannot.  It is comfort, peace, vision, brilliance, hope, awe and encouragement - in perfect harmony.</div>
        <div>Simply put, music brings us to God.</div>
        <div>It is a privilege to share the Live All In journey and music with you.</div>
